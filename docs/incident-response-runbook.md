# Incident Response Runbook

This runbook provides guidance for responding to incidents and outages.

## Incident Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | Service is down or unusable for all users | Immediate (< 15 min) | < 4 hours | - Database unavailable<br>- API service completely down<br>- Data breach |
| P2 - High | Major functionality impacted for many users | < 30 min | < 8 hours | - Significant performance degradation<br>- Partial service outage<br>- Data processing delays |
| P3 - Medium | Minor functionality impacted for some users | < 2 hours | < 24 hours | - Non-critical feature unavailable<br>- Intermittent issues<br>- Minor performance issues |
| P4 - Low | Minimal impact, cosmetic issues | < 1 business day | < 1 week | - UI/UX issues<br>- Documentation errors<br>- Non-urgent enhancement requests |

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection

Incidents can be detected through:
- CloudWatch Alarms
- User reports
- Monitoring dashboards
- Automated health checks

### 2. Triage

When an incident is detected:

1. Acknowledge the alert in the alerting system
2. Determine the severity level based on impact
3. Create an incident ticket in the tracking system
4. Notify the appropriate team members based on severity
5. Start an incident channel in Slack (for P1/P2 incidents)

### 3. Investigation

1. Access the CloudWatch dashboard for the affected service
2. Check recent deployments or changes
3. Review logs in CloudWatch Logs
4. Check the health of dependent services
5. Identify the root cause

### 4. Mitigation

1. Implement temporary fixes to restore service:
   - Roll back recent deployments if applicable
   - Scale up resources if performance-related
   - Restart services if appropriate
   - Failover to standby resources if available

2. Communicate status updates to stakeholders

### 5. Resolution

1. Implement permanent fixes
2. Verify the service is fully restored
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Close the incident ticket

### 6. Post-Incident Review

1. Conduct a blameless post-mortem
2. Document the root cause
3. Identify preventive measures
4. Create action items to prevent recurrence
5. Share learnings with the team

## Common Incidents and Remediation Steps

### Database Issues

#### RDS High CPU Utilization

1. Check CloudWatch metrics for database load
2. Review slow query logs
3. Identify and optimize problematic queries
4. Consider scaling up the instance if needed
5. Implement query caching if appropriate

#### RDS Storage Space Low

1. Check CloudWatch metrics for storage usage trends
2. Identify large tables or logs consuming space
3. Clean up unnecessary data or logs
4. Increase allocated storage
5. Implement data archiving strategy

### ECS Service Issues

#### ECS Service Deployment Failure

1. Check ECS deployment logs
2. Verify container health checks
3. Review application logs for errors
4. Roll back to previous version if needed
5. Fix issues and redeploy

#### ECS Service High CPU/Memory

1. Check CloudWatch metrics for resource usage
2. Identify resource-intensive operations
3. Scale out the service (add more tasks)
4. Consider scaling up task size
5. Optimize application code if needed

### Network Issues

#### ALB 5XX Errors

1. Check target group health
2. Review ECS service logs
3. Verify security group rules
4. Check for backend service errors
5. Implement retry logic if appropriate

#### VPC Endpoint Connectivity Issues

1. Verify VPC endpoint status
2. Check security group rules
3. Validate IAM permissions
4. Review network ACLs
5. Check AWS service status

## Emergency Contacts

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| On-call Engineer | First responder for all incidents |
| DevOps Lead | Escalation point for P1/P2 incidents |
| Security Team | Data breach and security incidents |
| AWS Support | AWS infrastructure issues |

## Disaster Recovery

### Database Recovery

1. Identify the point-in-time to recover to
2. Initiate RDS point-in-time recovery
3. Verify data integrity after recovery
4. Update connection strings if needed
5. Monitor performance after recovery

### Service Recovery

1. Verify infrastructure is operational
2. Deploy services in order of dependency
3. Run health checks on each service
4. Verify end-to-end functionality
5. Monitor for any issues after recovery

## Backup and Restore Procedures

### Database Backups

- Automated backups are configured for RDS
- Retention period: 7 days (dev), 30 days (staging/prod)
- Manual snapshots are taken before major changes

### Restore Procedure

1. Identify the backup to restore from
2. Create a new RDS instance from the backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Update application configuration
5. Redirect traffic to the new instance

## Security Incident Response

### Data Breach

1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Notify security team immediately
4. Identify the scope of the breach
5. Follow the data breach notification procedure
6. Implement containment measures
7. Conduct forensic analysis
8. Develop and execute remediation plan

### Unauthorized Access

1. Revoke compromised credentials
2. Audit access logs
3. Verify IAM permissions
4. Rotate affected secrets
5. Implement additional security controls
