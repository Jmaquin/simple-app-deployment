# Secure application - Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the infrastructure architecture for a secure application with an AI component. The architecture prioritizes security, ease of deployment, observability, developer experience, and scalability.

## Infrastructure Components

### Cloud Provider: AWS

#### Compute & Application Services
- **Backend API**: AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate
  - Containerized Node.js/NestJS application
  - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization
  - Deployed in private subnets with NAT gateway access

- **Frontend**: CloudFront + S3
  - React SPA hosted in S3 bucket
  - CloudFront for distribution and HTTPS termination
  - WAF integration for additional security

- **AI Component**: ECS with Fargate or SageMaker
  - Python-based ML service containerized in ECS
  - Alternative: SageMaker for managed ML deployment
  - Optional: GPU instances available as needed for inference

#### Data Storage
- **Database**: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
  - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
  - Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
  - Encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Private subnet placement with security group restrictions

#### Networking
- **VPC Architecture**:
  - Private subnets for application and database tiers
  - Public subnets for load balancers and NAT gateways
  - Network ACLs and security groups for defense-in-depth
  - VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

- **API Gateway**:
  - Application Load Balancer for backend services
  - TLS termination and certificate management
  - Connection to private ECS services

#### Security
- **Data Protection**:
  - Encryption at rest for all data stores (S3, RDS)
  - TLS for all data in transit
  - KMS for key management
  - HIPAA-compliant configurations

- **Access Control**:
  - IAM roles with least privilege principle
  - Service-to-service authentication via IAM roles
  - AWS Secrets Manager for credential management
  - VPC endpoints for AWS service access without internet exposure

#### Observability
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + X-Ray
  - Custom metrics and dashboards
  - Service maps and distributed tracing
  - Alarm configuration for critical metrics

- **Logging**:
  - Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
  - Log retention policies aligned with compliance requirements
  - Log insights for querying and analysis

- **Alerting**:
  - SNS for notification delivery
  - Integration with an incident management platform
  - Actionable alerts with runbook links

## Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation:
  - Automated testing on PR
  - Infrastructure validation with Terraform plan
  - Deployment to staging on merge to main
  - Manual approval for production deployment

### Environment Strategy
- **Three-environment approach**:
  - Development: For feature development and testing
  - Staging: Production-like for final validation
  - Production: Live environment with stricter access controls

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - Terraform for all infrastructure provisioning
  - Modular design for reusability across environments
  - State management in S3 with DynamoDB locking or Terraform cloud for easier collaboration

### Secrets Management
- AWS Secrets Manager for application secrets
- GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipeline credentials
- IAM roles for service-to-service authentication

## Compliance & Security Posture
- Regular security scanning and compliance audits
- Immutable infrastructure approach
- Automated patching and updates
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
